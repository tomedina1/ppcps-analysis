# ppcps-analysis 

This project analyzes Personal Care and Pharmaceutical Product concentrations throughout Southern California. The work was done with the Keller Research Team and greatly increased efficiency in data analysis.

The functions read in the excel sheet and clean up the data set into tidy data form.
